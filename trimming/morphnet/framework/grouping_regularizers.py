"""Regularizers that group other regularizers for residual connections.

An element-wise operation between two tensors (addition, multiplication, maximum
etc.) imposes a constraint of equality on the shapes of the constituents. For
example, if A, B are convolutions, and another op in the network
receives A + B as input, it means that the i-th output of A is tied to the i-th
output of B. Only if the i-th output was regularized away by the regularizer in
both A and B can we discard the i-th activation in both.

Therefore we group the i-th output of A and the i-th output of B in a group
LASSO, a group for each i. The grouping methods can vary, and this file offers
several variants.

Residual connections, in ResNet or in RNNs, are examples where this kind of
grouping is needed.
